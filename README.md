# VentureHiveX

VentureHiveX is a production-grade Web3 crowdfunding platform that enables businesses to raise funds through tokenized equity campaigns while allowing investors to participate transparently using blockchain-backed smart contracts.

The platform is designed with real-world architecture principles, combining on-chain trust with off-chain performance. It supports campaign creation, investments, refunds, withdrawals, and role-based dashboards, and is built with a clear roadmap toward introducing a native secondary market for trading campaign tokens.
